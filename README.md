# Flutter-Moving-Square
All the requirements mentioned in the problem statement have been implemented in this project.

# Features 
- The square starts in the center of the screen.
- "Right" moves the square to the right edge of the screen.
- "Left" moves the square to the left edge of the screen.
- Disable "Right" when the square is at the right edge.
- Disable "Left" when the square is at the left edge.
- Animate the movement with a 1-second duration.
- Disable both buttons during animation.

# Suggestions
- The "Left" and "Right" buttons are not in the correct order intuitively.
- There is no option to go back to centre of the screen once it has been moved to either right or left edge of the screen.
